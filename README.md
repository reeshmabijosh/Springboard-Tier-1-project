The Business Problem
You’re working for a marketing consultancy firm (congrats on the new job!) One of your
clients is a company that designs operating systems, and they want to build a major
apps store into their user interface. To this end, they want to know whether Google Play
apps have higher reviews on average than Apple Store apps (or vice versa) , as they’re
intending to strike a deal with just one of these companies.
